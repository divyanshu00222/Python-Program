Q1: What is Recursion?

Answer:
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems until reaching a base case.

Q2: What is a Base Case and Recursive Case?

Answer:

Base Case: Condition to stop recursion.

Recursive Case: Function calling itself again.

Example:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:  # Base case
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)  # Recursive case

Q3: What happens if there’s no base case?

Answer:
The function calls itself infinitely, causing a RecursionError (stack overflow).

Q4: What is the difference between Recursion and Iteration?
Feature	Recursion	Iteration
Uses	Function calls	Loops
Memory	Uses Call Stack	Constant memory
Readability	Simple for complex problems	Faster execution
Example	Tower of Hanoi	For loop
Q5: What is the maximum recursion depth in Python?

Answer:
By default, Python allows around 1000 recursive calls before a RecursionError.
You can check using:

import sys
print(sys.getrecursionlimit())
