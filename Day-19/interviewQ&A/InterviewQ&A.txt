Q1: What is the difference between stable and unstable sorting?

Answer:

Stable: Keeps the order of equal elements (like Merge Sort).

Unstable: May change order (like Quick Sort).

Q2: What is the best sorting algorithm for large datasets?

Answer:
✅ Merge Sort — O(n log n), stable, great for linked lists and large data.

Q3: What is the average and worst-case time complexity of Quick Sort?

Answer:

Average: O(n log n)

Worst: O(n²) when pivot is poorly chosen.

Q4: What sorting algorithms are built into Python?

Answer:
Python uses Timsort, a hybrid of Merge + Insertion Sort.
✅ Best case: O(n), Worst: O(n log n).

Q5: What’s the space complexity of Merge Sort vs Quick Sort?
Algorithm	Time	Space	Stable
Merge Sort	O(n log n)	O(n)	✅ Yes
Quick Sort	O(n log n)	O(log n)	❌ No
