🧩 Q1. What is the difference between List and Dictionary in Python?

Answer:

Feature	List	Dictionary
Structure	Ordered collection of items	Key-Value pairs
Access	Access by index (e.g., my_list[0])	Access by key (e.g., my_dict["key"])
Example	[10, 20, 30]	{"name": "Divyanshu", "age": 23}
Use Case	When order matters	When you need fast lookup or mapping

✅ Tip: Use List for sequences, and Dict for relationships.

⚡ Q2. How does Hashing improve lookup time?

Answer:

Hashing converts keys into a fixed-size number (called hash value).

In Python, dictionaries use hashing internally.

Lookup time becomes O(1) on average because you jump directly to the memory address instead of searching sequentially.

📘 Example:

users = {"divyanshu": 23, "sayali": 24}
print(users["divyanshu"])  # Direct access using hash

🧭 Q3. What is BFS and DFS? Where are they used?

Answer:

BFS (Breadth-First Search):
Visits nodes level by level using a queue.
🔹 Used in finding shortest paths or nearby connections.

DFS (Depth-First Search):
Visits as deep as possible before backtracking using a stack or recursion.
🔹 Used in maze solving, cycle detection, and backtracking problems.

📘 Example BFS Use: Google Maps shortest route
📘 Example DFS Use: File explorer (drilling into folders)

🌐 Q4. Explain how Graph traversal is used in real life.

Answer:

Social Networks: Finding friend suggestions (mutual connections).

Navigation Apps: Shortest route (Google Maps uses BFS + Dijkstra).

Recommendation Systems: Finding similar users or products.

Networking: Finding reachable devices in a network.

⏱ Q5. What is the time complexity of BFS?

Answer:

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
where V = number of vertices, E = number of edges.

Space Complexity: O(V) (due to queue + visited set)

✅ Reason: Every node and edge is visited exactly once.
