Q1: What is the difference between Linear and Binary Search?

Answer:

Feature	Linear	Binary
Requirement	Works on any array	Needs sorted array
Time	O(n)	O(log n)
Space	O(1)	O(1)
Approach	Sequential scan	Divide and conquer
Q2: What is a Binary Search Tree?

Answer:
A BST is a data structure where:

Each node has at most two children.

Left child < Root < Right child.

Q3: Why is BST better than a normal list for searching?

Answer:
Because search, insert, and delete operations in BST take O(log n) time, while in a list they take O(n).

Q4: What are the traversal types in a BST?

Answer:

Inorder (Left, Root, Right) – Sorted order.

Preorder (Root, Left, Right) – Used in tree copying.

Postorder (Left, Right, Root) – Used in deletion.

Q5: What happens if a BST is unbalanced?

Answer:
It behaves like a linked list (worst-case time: O(n)).
👉 Solution: Use AVL Trees or Red-Black Trees to stay balanced.
