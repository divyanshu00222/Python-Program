✅ Q1. Difference between linear and binary search?
Linear Search	Binary Search
Sequential	Divide and conquer
Works on unsorted data	Requires sorted data
✅ Q2. Time complexity of binary search?

O(log n)

✅ Q3. What is stable sorting?

A sorting algorithm that maintains the relative order of equal elements (e.g., Merge Sort).

✅ Q4. Fastest sorting algorithm?

QuickSort / MergeSort (average O(n log n))

✅ Q5. Which is better: iterative or recursive binary search?

Iterative is memory-efficient, but recursive is easier to understand.
